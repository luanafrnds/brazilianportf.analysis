# Brazilian Portfolio Analysis
I analyzed the brazilian stock market using Pyhton.
This project involves analyzing a portfolio of Brazilian stocks to track their performance, to calculate gains and losses, and visualize the results using interactive charts. The analysis is done using Python, leveraging libraries like yfinance for stock data, pandas for data manipulation, and plotly for data visualization. It's amazing what Python is capable to do, and it's been amazing to learn more about it.
